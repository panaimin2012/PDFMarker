<h2>PDF Marker (v0.8) User's Manual</h2>

<h4>1. How to open a PDF file</h4>

If the file is already in the recently opened list, just click the file to open it. Else use the PDF file icon <img src="ic_pdf.png" width="32" height="32" alt=""> from the tool panel to select the file from directory tree. 

To delete a file from the recently opened list, hover (long click) the item.

<h4>2. How to zoom and drag page</h4>

Use two fingers to expand or shrink the screen. When zoomed in, use one finger to drag the page.

<h4>3. What is the scissor <img src="ic_cut.png" width="32" height="32" alt=""> for?</h4>

Scissor is used to cut white page edges. You can adjust page zooming and position and cut page so page edges not in screen range will not be displayed again.

<h4>4. How to turn pages</h4>

Fling on the screen wide enough to turn to next or previous page. If fling is not wide, a dialog will display asking for page number to go. 

<h4>5. How to write on the page</h4>

Click the mode button <img src="ic_hand.png" width="32" height="32" alt="">in the tool panel to change it to write mode. And then you can write on the screen with a marker or pencil. In write mode, zoom and drag doesn't work. Click the mode button again to change back to hand mode which allows zooming and dragging.

In write mode, click the stationary button<img src="ic_pencil.png" width="32" height="32" alt="">, a stationary dialog will appear and allow you to change a pen (marker). You can also choose an eraser to remove your writing on the page. 

<h4>7. How many different stationaries are there in the application?</h4>

We have pencils (2H to 2B), color markers (yellow, pink, green) and different color pencils, and 2 kind of erasers as well â€“ regular and super.

A super eraser removes the intersecting strokes completely, which is recommended because it reduces the stroke in memory and disk.

<h4>9. Can I skip the page movement animation</h4>

Yes you can change the setting from preference screen.

<h4>10. Oops, it crashed! What can I do?</h4>

Crash is shameful... If you see Report button, please report so I can fix the problem. Thanks.
